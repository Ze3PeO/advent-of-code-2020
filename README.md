# aoc2020 (Advent of Code 2020)

This is a simple IntelliJ Java Project for Advent of Code 2020. The solution of puzzles are executable by running the Main class (Main.java).
Input the desired day to run it (1-24).

All solutions have their own classes (e.g. Day2.java) with a start funtion and two functions for each puzzle of the related day (e.g. p1() and p2()).
