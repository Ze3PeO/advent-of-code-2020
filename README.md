# advent-of-code-2020

This is a simple IntelliJ Java Project for Advent of Code 2020. The solutions of puzzles are executable by running the Main class (Main.java).
Simply input the desired day to run it (1-24).

All solutions have their own classes (e.g. Day2.java) with a start function and two functions for each puzzle of the related day (e.g. p1() and p2()).
They can be found in the package "puzzle". 

The package "util" contains some helper classes (e.g. IO, Datastructures). Input data is stored in the ressources folder (res/input/).
